Don't read the following .pdf with the usual
claude pdf reader as you get stuck in a too large loop.

You ran an OCR of AltairBASIC-1975.pdf
creating AltairBASIC-1975-v0.txt

read AltairBASIC-1975-v0.txt
now create AltairBASIC-1975-v1.txt
Clean up as described below:

The v0 text is a listing file of assembling
code for an 8080 processor.

Each line with code has :

A-4digit hnumber B-2digit or C-4digt or D-6digit

hhumber hex number
A-4 digit 16bit address in memory, only incements. goes up 1 per byte on previous line
B-one byte opcode, fore exampe E1 is the opcode for pop h
C-two byte, this is a one byte opcode followed by immediate data 1 byte
 for example 3E01 movi a,1 ; 3E is the opcode for mvi, 1 is the data
D-one bute opcode followed by two bytes, forms a 16bit number
  low byte first
   for example: 202F CD681C     CALL    SIGNACC
  here 202f address where it is located
  cd - call opcode
  1c68 address of SIGNACC

List of all the opcodes ~/src/cpmemu/src/8080.txt

Clean up the file so it all makes sense. Between the numbers and the
opcodes and data there is duplicate info.  Use the duplication so
sort out errors.

The number fields at the start of each line are all numbers
so of its o2 it is 02.

The address numbers go up by the right amount.
If one line is "0023 00 nop" the next will begin 0024, as nop is one byte

The next field the hex number byte needs to match the opcode text.
For the immediate data it should match the data in the argument column
For 2 byte data it should match the label.

As you make passes over the data, record the value of each label you see
it isn't always filled in.  WHen it is it needs to match. for example
...
FLMMMAC :
19A9 CD0000     CALL    LDRGMM ;COMPUTE MM~AC
...
here FLMMAC has the value of 19A9
later
...
1E89 CDA919     CALL FLMMMAC
...
here you can see that the use of FLMMAC has the same value

fix the spaceing so the columns align.
have one space after the opcode before the opcode argument
align the ; comment collumns
