the main file to work on here is 4kbas40.mac.
It is built with build_4k.sh
producing 4kbas40_built.bin
which should always match byte for byte with 4kbas40.bin
the historical basic from year 1980ish.
The manual for the assembler is
~/um80_and_friends/docs/external/m80.pdf and l80.pdf for the linker.
Sources of um80 ul80 are in ~/um80_and_friends
