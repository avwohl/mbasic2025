Make a plan to make the following programs
Microsoft relased the sources of thier 1980s era basic interpreter.
See mbasic_src for the files.
The tools to build them ran on 8080 computers.
Make a replacement set of assembler, linker, library manger, cross ref tool
that can run on linux.
See the .pdf files in the docs directory for specifications of what to emulate.
Note: only implement the data in and out to programs, not the command line parsing or
switches.  For each of the programs use normal linux conventions for the program
arguments.
Write this code in .py
For each program use its microsoft name preceded by u (for unix). For example
the M80.COM you make would be called um80 (note: no .py in name of programs, only .py for libraries).
